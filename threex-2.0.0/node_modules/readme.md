npm4require.js: workflow for managing web package with npm.js and require.js
============================================================================

npm4require doesnt include codes, or tools for command lines.
It is only a workflow that you can use to handle web modules.
It use normal npm.js and require.js code and configuration.
It is very vendor.js way to handle package.

## Principles
* Using npm.js and require.js to manage modules on the web
* npm.js to handle module storing and version
* require.js to load them in browser

## Module installation

* to install a module ```threex.loop``` 

```
npm install threex.loop
```

* it will install the module in ```./node_modules```

## modules loading

It is loaded with require.js. So first load require.js

```
<script src="vendor/require.js/require.js"></script>
```

here is an example of loading a modules with require.js

```
require(['node_modules/threex.loop/package.require'], function(){
})
```

## Module Folder Description

There is only 2 files required

### package.json
* this file MUST exists
* for npm

### package.require.js
* this is a file in javascript, it contains the code to load the module with require.js
  * so it is a require.js related function
  * see require.js docs for how to do it
  * or simply look at other modules
* this file MUST exist
* for example, the ```package.require.js``` to load a single javascript file ```index.js``` 

```
define( [ './index.js',
	], function(){
});
```
